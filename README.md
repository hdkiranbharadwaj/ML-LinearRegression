# ML-LinearRegression
In Statistics, Linear Regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.Linear Regression is used in this project to fetch us a linear relationship with the features of the car and the selling price in order to deliver us a mort accurate price in reference to the data on which the model is being trained.


## Here we have our data sheet

### So Lets Get On To The Project
In the [model.ipynp](Car%20Price%20Prediction/model.ipynb) file we have imported necessary libraries to perform various mathematical operations and training on and from the data and we have imported the csv file aswell.
